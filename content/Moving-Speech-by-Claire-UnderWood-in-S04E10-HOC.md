Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor to introduce Secretary of State Catherine Durant. Thank you, thank you very much.
I know that all of you join me. I know that all of you join me in offering our sincere condolences to the First Lady for her loss.
Tonight, I want to offer my sincere gratitude to all the delegates who have honored me with their support during the course of this convention.
Thank you so much. However, after much deliberation...I have decided that I have more to offer you as Secretary of State than to resign and run for office. But I want to encourage every one of you who has supported me to join me in supporting this extraordinary woman, the First Lady of the United States, Claire Hale Underwood. Thank you.

Good evening. As all of you know, my mother, Elizabeth Constance Hale, passed away last night after a long illness.
She was a strong woman...a fierce Texan...We had... a difficult relationship from childhood onwards.
At times, there were long periods of estrangement. We hurt each other... often and deeply. If there was one good thing that came from my mother's illness...it gave us a chance to reconnect, to mend old wounds. And that's not an opportunity people always get before a parent dies, and I'm grateful to have had that.
And what am I doing here? I’m here because my mother wanted me to be. Yesterday, before she passed, she said to me, “Claire... do this. If the people want it, listen to them. And if you lose, then you lose. But if you win...be honored, be humbled, and win this election with Francis!” And I told her, I said, "The Conway’s are tough opponents."
And she said, "They may be tough, but they're not Texas tough."
Loss is a sobering phenomenon. Several months ago, I almost lost my husband. Our nation almost lost a President. Loss makes us re-evaluate what we hold dear. And I'll tell you, there were...times in the not too distant past, where Francis and I, we... almost lost our marriage. Hard times when we thought we wouldn't make it. And like many of you know, marriage isn't always the smoothest road.
And it took the actions of a deranged young man to remind me how important Francis is to me.
And now, with my mother gone...He’s the only family I have left.
I trust Francis Underwood with my life, with our nation, with our future. I hope you will, too. And if you trust the both of us, I'll heed my mother's words, and I'll be honored if you nominate me as his running mate. Thank You!

女士们先生们：我很荣幸为大家介绍，国务卿凯瑟琳•杜兰特！谢谢！非常感谢大家，我知道大家和我一样，都对第一夫人亲人的离世表示诚挚慰唁。
今晚，我想向在代表大会上支持我的各位代表，致以我最真挚的感谢！我非常感谢你们，然而，经过深思熟虑，我决定，与辞职参加选举相比，作为国务卿，我能更好地为大家服务，但我希望支持我的各位，和我一起支持这位非凡的女性，美国第一夫人，克莱尔•黑尔•安德伍德，谢谢！
晚上好！正如大家所知，我母亲，伊丽莎白•康斯坦斯•黑尔，久病后于昨晚去世。她是个坚强的女人...，一个生猛的德州人；从小...我和她关系就不好，我们曾有过很长时间的疏离，我们经常深深地伤害对方。如果说母亲的病带来了什么好事，那就是：让我们有机会重新开始往来，抚平旧伤。人们并不是都能在父母离世前有这样的机会，我很感激有这样的机会，那我在这里做什么呢？我站在这里，是因为这是我母亲所希望的，昨天在她去世之前，她对我说，"克莱尔...去做吧，如果这是人们希望的，听他们的，如果失败了，那就是失败了；但是如果你赢了...要感到荣幸，保持谦逊，和弗兰西斯一起赢得选举！"，我告诉她：“康威夫妇是非常厉害的对手。”她说：“也许是吧。但也不比德州人。”失去让我们深思！几个月前，我差点失去了我丈夫，我们的国家差点失去了总统。失去让我们重新审视我们珍惜的一切！我还要告诉你们...就在不久之前，弗兰西斯和我...差点失去我们的婚姻。我们遇到了困难，还以为坚持不下去了。正如很多人所知，婚姻并非总是一帆风顺，是一个精神错乱的年轻人让我记起弗兰西斯对我有多重要。现在，我母亲去世了...他就是我唯一的亲人了。我愿把我的人生、我们的国家和未来、托付给弗兰西斯•安德伍德，我希望你们也能信任他，如果你们信任我们，我会谨遵母亲的话，如被提名为他的竞选搭档，我将深感荣幸！
